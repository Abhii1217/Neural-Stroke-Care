# 🧠 Neural Stroke Care

## 📌 Overview

Neural Stroke Care is a full-stack machine learning web application designed to predict stroke risk using demographic and medical attributes.

It provides:
- Doctor & patient authentication
- Dashboard for predictions and history
- Model training & evaluation utilities
- Database integration
- Clean UI with HTML / CSS templates

## 📌 Features

✅ Stroke prediction using a trained ML model  
✅ User authentication (Doctor / Patient)  
✅ SQLite database for storing user info & test history  
✅ Model training & evaluation scripts  
✅ Visualizations: ROC, confusion matrix, PR curves  
✅ Clean web UI with Flask templates

## 🏗 Architecture

User → Flask Backend → Preprocessing Pipeline → SMOTE → Logistic Regression → Prediction → Result Dashboard

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

### Algorithm Used
- **Logistic Regression**
- Solver: `saga`
- Max iterations: 2000
- Class weight: `balanced`
- Regularization strength: `C=1.0`

### Imbalance Handling
- **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**
- Sampling strategy: `0.6`
- Random state: `42`

### Preprocessing
- OneHot Encoding for categorical features
- Numeric features passed through directly
- ColumnTransformer used for pipeline structure

### Model Performance (as defined in training script)
- Recall at 0.40 threshold: ~95%
- AUC: ~0.98

The final model is saved as a serialized pipeline using `joblib`.
